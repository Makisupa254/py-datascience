GitHub has some great tutorials for getting your computer setup for this https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

### Fork the repository
Hit the fork button at the repository home (http://github.com/nsamala/py-datascience). This will give you a copy of the repository to mess around with as you please.

Once that is complete, make a note of the HTTPS clone url (found in the bottom right of the webpage for your forked repository) and run the following commands in a terminal on your computer:
'''
git clone [https clone url goes here] && cd py-datascience
'''

### Setup Travis CI (for unit testing)
Go to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and login with your GitHub account. Hit the toggle switch next to py-datascience to enable builds for your repository.

## Run a test
TODO: add a sample here to run and unit test

## Next Steps
Awesome! Time to run to the first tutorial: (Loading + Parsing your data)[lessons/LoadParseData.md]
